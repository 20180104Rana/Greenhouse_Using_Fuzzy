# Greenhouse_Using_Fuzzy
## Introduction
* A greenhouse is a uniquely controlled environment that allows the gardener to exercise some control over nature where plants are concerned. This gives the northern gardener a longer growing season, allows outside-of-zone plants to be cultivated, protects tender starts and newly propagated plants, and generally creates the ideal growing zone for a host of plant life. Greenhouse watering systems are important parts of creating this ultimate growing climate.
* Water for greenhouses may be piped in professionally or brought in through a hose or drip system. Whichever method you use in your approach, the creation of timing, flow amounts, zones, and type of delivery are all part of greenhouse irrigation.

## Problem understanding
